refactor(graphics): extract swap chain into separate class

Decouple swap chain ownership from D3D12Device to prepare for headless
rendering mode. Introduce RenderTargets struct as abstraction layer so
render/encode pipeline can work with either swap chain or offscreen
buffers.

Changes:
- Add D3D12SwapChain class managing IDXGISwapChain4, back buffers, RTV heap
- Add RenderTargets struct as plain data carrier for rendering resources
- Simplify D3D12Device to focus on device/queue/fence management
- Update fence APIs to accept explicit frame indices instead of reading internal state
- Update FrameCoordinator to depend on RenderTargets reference
- Update main loop to instantiate swap chain separately from device

Present() now isolated to swap chain class, enabling future headless mode
where presentation is skipped entirely.
