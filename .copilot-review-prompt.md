# Review Changed Files & Stage

Review the changed files in this repository and:
1. Summarize what changed and why
2. Suggest a concise commit message following conventional commits and stage it
3. Check formatting
4. Check build status
5. Show and append to a log file the output file size of minsizerel binaries created, and total source lines in /src using cloc. Just these for now.
6. Make a highlights page in html with snippets showing what happened, and open it up for me to read. Make sure C++ code is formatted nicely.
